# Render.com Deployment Fix

## The Problem
Your Render deployment failed because the build command was incorrectly set to:
```
Build Command: pip install -r render_requirements.txt
```

## The Solution
In your Render dashboard, change the build command to just:
```
pip install -r render_requirements.txt
```

Remove the "Build Command:" prefix - that's just the label, not part of the actual command.

## Render Configuration Settings

### Environment
- **Environment**: Python 3

### Build Command
```
pip install -r render_requirements.txt
```

### Start Command
```
python main.py
```

### Environment Variables
Add these in your Render dashboard:
- `BOT_TOKEN` = `8435159197:AAG4xNOnPbB2Aqj7wou8NM01JRerjABJ7ao`
- `ADMIN_IDS` = `1096693642`

## Files Ready for Deployment
- ✅ `render_requirements.txt` - Updated with all dependencies including lottie
- ✅ `main.py` - Bot entry point
- ✅ `config.py` - Configuration management
- ✅ All other bot files are ready

## Deploy Steps
1. Connect your GitHub repo to Render
2. Set build command: `pip install -r render_requirements.txt` 
3. Set start command: `python main.py`
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy

Your bot will work properly once the build command is fixed!
